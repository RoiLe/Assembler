Final project in a laboratory course in systems programming
The purpose of this project is to build an copiler for 27-instruction asssembly language, for an imaginary 32-bit CPU and 32 bits of memory size. 

By changing some settings, you can use this compiler for a real computer as needed.


#USE on linux
1) install the system 
2) compile by script:
        Make
3) Bring some example file from "inputs outputs" directory
4) run : ./assembler 'exampleName.as'       # You can run more then one assembly file
5) The outputs Hexas files will apear in the main directory.
