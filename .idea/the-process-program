the process of the code 

main : get assembly file arguments (1-3) ---> 
if (there is an errors)
{continue to the next file.}
else
{continue the file to the output processing.}


theprogram() func: get the file from the main
1. send the file to checkFileName() func
(that return if all the erros that could be in the name of the file )

- exit from the file if not okay. 
  
2. send the file and the empty symbole table to firstPass() func
(that pass on the file and keeps in table the correct values [by course definition] )

call to other functions:
- checks which input is it and if the input is okay
- convert to binary 
- create the instruction line or prompt line and put them in the right place in the image
- create a symboles table  

3. send the file and the symbole table to secondPass() func
(that pass on the file and fills in table the values that the firstPass func didn't)
